# Password Encryptor
This encryptor uses a Caesar cipher to encrypt passwords locally. This is not meant to be secure, so do not use it!
The program stores the number of digits as the first character of the encrypted password, then stores the number the program "shifts" the alphabet
as the next characters in the encrypted password.
## Do not use this program for security!
Seriously. Don't.
